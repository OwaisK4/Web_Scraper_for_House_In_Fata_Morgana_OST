### Web Scraper

A barebones web scraper I wrote to scrape the complete OST of "The House in Fata Morgana" from Khinsider website. The only reason for this repo's existence is my laziness to individually download 68 different tracks by hand. Written in about half an hour so don't expect any exception handling for the requests.get part.
Anyway though, the visual novel was top-tier. Highly recommended to everyone, even someone who has never played a visual novel before.
